## About The App
Book Explorer is a simple app meant to acquaint myself with the basics APIs and their utilisation in the realm of programming and software development.
The app is connected to Google Books via an API and it requests information according to user input, displaying them below the input field.

## Screenshots
Add here atleast one screenshot of the working application

## Technologies
For this project I utilised JavaScript for the script and everything that makes the app tick, HTML for the basic structure and divs and such, and CSS for a simple interface.

## Setup
You may run the app via the given link:
- Open the link
- Add your desired search terms
- Click on search
- Review the results.
    - You may explore any work further by clicking on the title and it will open a direct link to the Google Books inventory.
If you decide to run it locally:
- Download all the files in this repository.
- Open the index.html in some browser.
- Ideally you can smoothly follow the same instructions as above, but you may encounter security/networking errors.
    - You may consider a plugin/add-on such as Moesif CORS. It might work.

## Status
Book Explorer is largely ready, even though I might still tinker with the UI to make it more accessible and pleasant to use.

- Past workshops.
- ChatGPT was utilised to complement my learning by asking it for examples on how certain technologies and methods work and can be used in various different situations.
    - I do believe it has been a reasonably "good" aide during this project since it has helped me process more indepth how certain aspects of JavaScript work and how they can be utilised.
    - I try not to blindly or passively "copy paste" what it gives me however, since I do fear that'd lead to losing my ability to think and solve problems on my own, but rather I seek to study everything it suggests in such a way that I understand what exactly it is suggesting and have the knowledge of determining if it's a good suggestion for my particular situation.
    - ChatGPT was also used to make a simple CSS "frame" which I've extensively modified and expanded to fit my purposes. It still needs some modifying.
- CoPilot was used to find typos.
